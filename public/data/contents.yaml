introduction:
  "
  I'm currently a student in my fourth - and final - year, working towards my bachelor's degree in software engineering at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences.
  

  I enjoy working with all sorts of technologies, be it for small webpages, larger web services, or standalone applications; but especially enjoy working on backend and related services because of the interesting and wide variety of technical challenges and learning opportunities they offer.
  

  One of my strengths is problem solving, and I am especially passionate about building high quality tools and utilities that can be easily used to tackle them.
  

  I'm currently looking for an internship or trainee position, as a part of my course's Practical Training module, to learn the in and outs of professional software development :)
  

  VS Code Pets enjoyer. (Clippy my beloved ❤️)

      * Developing prototype cross-platform UI application for Nemo Outdoor using web technologies

      * UI application built with Angular 15, running in a C# WinForms Edge WebView2 host application for native system API support

      * Application was built from scratch, using Nemo Outdoor's existing RestAPI as the backend

      * Developed custom window-based layout system written in Angular used to display multiple custom made graphs and data views in the same page

      * UI side measurement service WebWorker to process multiple simultaneous WebSockets with live measurement data from Outdoor

      * Native Windows support via Edge WebView2 as a standalone application, cross platform support via any web-browser

        It was designed as a small \"replacement\" for cloud hosting, since during our studies we often needed to host our projects but most services were paid and way too much of an overkill for a small app or website.
        

        Boop does virtually everything we needed, all while being cute :)
        
        
        It was (and still is) a fun side-project between our periods to see how something like this could work out.

      This small framework was designed to provide an easy to use view management system for Unity's new UI system (UI Toolkit).


      Originally it was built for a specific project (an entirely UI based idle mobile game), but grew large enough to become its own thing.


      Given how there is no official framework for this use case, I decided to release it as a Unity package to fill the gap.
