introduction:
  "
  I'm currently a student in my fourth - and final - year, working towards my bachelor's degree in software engineering at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences.
  

  I enjoy working with all sorts of technologies, be it for webpages, large web services, or standalone applications regardless of platform; but especially enjoy working on more backend-side and related services because of the interesting and wide variety of technical challenges and learning opportunities they offer.
  

  One of my strengths is problem solving, and I am especially passionate about building high quality tools and utilities that can be easily used to tackle them. I especially love to work on helping other people and devs with creating solutions for them, as my work can have a real and immediate impact. 
  

  I'm currently looking for an awesome new place with challenging project to work on, as I am slowly finishing my studies. If that sounds like a guy you want on your team, do contact me :)
  

  VS Code Pets enjoyer. (Clippy my beloved ❤️)

      * Developed cross-platform UI application for [Nemo Outdoor](https://www.keysight.com/fi/en/product/NTA50000B/nemo-outdoor-5g-nr-drive-test-solution.html) using web technologies

      * UI application built with Angular 15, running in a C# WinForms Edge WebView2 host application for native Windows API support

      * Application was built from scratch, using Nemo Outdoor's existing RestAPI as the backend and leveraging Keysight's internal Alloy Component Library

      * [Developed custom window-based layout system written in Angular](/posts/ks-window-layout) used to display multiple custom data views with live graphs in the same page

      * Live measurement data via an UI side Measurement Service using WebWorker to process multiple simultaneous WebSockets from Outdoor

      * Native Windows support via Edge WebView2 as a standalone application, cross platform support via any web-browser

      * Redesigned application flow and user experience, device management, and workspace system

      * Developed custom build tooling that integrates into Outdoor's current build workflow

        It was designed as a small \"replacement\" for cloud hosting, since during our studies we often needed to host our projects but most services were paid and way too much of an overkill for a small app or website.
        

        Boop does virtually everything we needed, all while being cute, and has been in use on my Raspberry Pi 4B since the start :)
        
        
        It was (and still is) a fun side-project between our periods to see how something like this could work out.

      This small framework was designed to provide an easy to use view management system for Unity's new UI system (UI Toolkit).


      Originally it was built for a specific project (an entirely UI based idle mobile game), but grew large enough to become its own thing.


      Given how there is no official framework for this use case, I decided to release it as a Unity package to fill the gap.

      Originally written during my first year studies for an assignment as an intro to JavaScript, it has evolved quite a lot since its very first iteration (based on a HTML table), to a capable little engine running on an HTML Canvas with spritesheet and object support.


      It has also been upgraded to TypeScript with the latest iteration, and several performance enchancements have been made, particularly in collision detection and rendering.


      There are also notes on how and why I changed things between versions, and what I learnt during development.
